# This program is a fortune teller. It asks the user to answer some questions
#and based on the response, it gives the player a fortune.
#everything seems to work!
# Core Concepts: print(), imput(), comments, escape characters, using single quptes and double quotes for strings
# Import Statements, conditions, the difference between = and ==,
#if statements, the time.sleep() functions, creating your own functions, elif statements
